                <h3>Role</h3>
                <p>UX Designer</p>

                <h3>Duration</h3>
                <p>4 weeeks in June 2022</p>

                <h3>Background</h3>
                <p><b>Wordstock</b> is the first design project I created as part of the UX Design course with
                    CareerFoundry. I
                    followed the steps of the Design Thinking Process to create a low fidelity prototype of Wordstock
                    which I tested on potential users to see how the design could be improved.</p>

                <h3>Tools</h3>
                <p>Pen and Paper</p>
                <p>Marvel</p>

                    <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
                </header>
                <p>To start the project, I looked at three Vocabulary Building apps to analyze what is currently on the
                    market</p>

                <h3>Word of the Day</h3>
                <img style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px;  width: 250px;" src="images/wordstock/image1.jpeg"
                    alt="" />
                <p>This app has a clean UI and provides clear navigation flow but does not 100% serve the purpose of
                    learning new vocabulary for the users. The app should provide better way to navigate between the
                    previous and next words. The ability to search for words is good. Paired with its capability of
                    voice in different accents and grouping of words can improve the usability of the application.
                    Though ads are important and driving factor for the free applications but should be more
                    strategically placed in the application and shouldn’t annoy users.</p>

                <h3>Vocab Junkie</h3>
                <img style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px;  width: 250px;" src="images/wordstock/image2.jpeg"
                    alt="" />
                <p>The current state of the app makes it difficult for the users to even sign up and gives a poor users
                    experience. Whole application will need UI overhaul. A better choice of contrast colors combined
                    with strategic placement of different elements will make UI look cleaner. Sign up form seems to be
                    long and can be shortened by just asking name instead of particularly asking first and last name.
                    Name can even be added later in the profile.</p>

                <h3>Atlas English</h3>
                <img style="margin-bottom: 20px; margin-top: 20px;  width: 250px;" src="images/wordstock/image3.jpeg"
                    alt="" />
                <p>The onboarding process makes app easy to navigate. The quiz at the beginning of the app helps to
                    curate the experience to the user’s vocabulary level but it is long and cannot be skipped. The
                    translation feature in this app makes it different from other apps but can be improved by allowing
                    to select different other native languages. By improving some of the app features the user
                    experience can be made even better.</p>

                <h3>Main Takeaway</h3>
                <p>Competitive Analysis allowed me to better understand the educational context and reasons users choose
                    vocabulary learning apps.</p>
            </div>

                    <h2>User Research</h2>
                </header>
                <p>I interviewed four people to discover what kind of vocabulary building app they would find useful.
                </p>
                <h3>Interview Questions</h3>
                <ul style="padding-left: 30px;margin-bottom: 10px;">

                    <li>When was the last time you had to study new vocabulary? What was the reason?</li>
                    <li>If you need to learn something new, how do you approach it? What ways works best the best for
                        you?</li>

                <h3>Doing</h3>
                <p>
                <ul style="padding-left: 30px;margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    <li>I work from home, don’t really have a fixed schedule as a freelancer (yet), so everyday can be
                        different.</li>
                    <li>I used to use a dictionary to look up for new words, but now I use google translate.</li>
                    <li>Last time when, I studied new vocabulary was when I moved to Belgium and did an attempt to study
                        Flemish, as it’s the 2nd local language where I live.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Thinking</h3>
                <p>
                <ul style="padding-left: 30px;margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    <li>I believe if I don’t use the words constantly, I forget it very quickly.</li>
                    <li>I believe that in order to remember new words, you need to use them regularly.</li>
                    <li> think because you don’t always get to practice with someone day-to-day what you learned, so you
                        forget it after a while.</li>
                    <li>I believe that to learn new words in another language is through immersion and exposure to
                        native speakers.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Feeling</h3>
                <p>
                <ul style="padding-left: 30px;margin-bottom: 10px;">
                    <li>I don’t really feel frustrated learning new words because we have the internet and access to all
                        types of information at our fingertips.</li>
                    <li>I get excited when I challenge myself by guessing the meaning of a word.</li>
                    <li>I will really feel motivated if app feels like a game, it makes it more fun to learn.</li>
                    <li>I feel adding feature like translation in various languages would be helpful for native speakers
                        for better understanding.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <h3>Interview Analysis</h3>
                <p>I listened to the recordings of the interviews and reviewed my notes to organise the interviewees’
                    comments into ‘Doing’, ‘Thinking’ and ‘Feeling’ statements.</p>
                <h3>Main Takeaway</h3>
                <p>The interviewees want an app that teaches them a new language through a quiz format , adding features
                    like translation in various languages and add audio, video and images to provide added context.</p>

                    building app to learn a new language.</p>
                <p>I developed a Proto-Persona to represent the needs, goals and behaviors of the potential users.</p>

                <p>I asked the participants to complete four scenario tasks and I recorded their comments. I wanted to
                    see how easily they navigated the prototype and find out what problems they had completing the task.

                    <li>You are moving to India and want to start learning Hindi. Your friend has recommended the
                        language learning app Wordstock. Open the app and sign up.</li>
                    <li>Although you are a beginner of learning Hindi, you already know how to greet people and how to
                        say goodbye. Choose the topic ‘Greetings’ and take a quiz to see how much you already know.</li>
                    <li>You have been in India for a couple of days and you would like to record the names of Indian
                        dishes you like. Create a set of flashcards with the name and description of the dishes.</li>
                    <li>A few days later, you are at a Indian restaurant and cannot remember the name of your favourite
                        Indian dish. Look up the word on the set of flashcards you created.</li>
                </ol>

                    Test Report
                </h3>
                <img style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px; max-width: 100%;" src="images/wordstock/image13.jpeg"
                    alt="" />
                <p>
                    I summarized the participants’ comments into observations in a usability test report. I gave
                    each observation a severity rating based on Jacob Nielsen’s scale and came up with
                    recommendations to solve the issues.</p>
                <h3>Prototype Improvements</h3>
                <h4>Signup Screen</h4>
                <div className="screen-image-wrap">
                    <img style="margin-top: 20px;  margin-bottom: 30px; max-width: 300px;"
                        src="images/wordstock/image14.jpeg" alt="" />
                    <img style="margin-top: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px;  max-width: 300px;"
                        src="images/wordstock/image15.jpeg" alt="" />
                </div>
                <p>Added continue with google option, also login option for existing users.
                    Added eye icon in password input field in both login and signup screen.</p>
                <h4>Review Flashcards Screen</h4>
                <div className="screen-image-wrap">
                    <img style="margin-top: 20px;  margin-bottom: 30px; max-width: 300px;"
                        src="images/wordstock/image16.jpeg" alt="" />

                </div>
                <p>View Flashcards in a list with a scrollbar Tab Bar
                    Designed a new ‘Create Flashcard’ icon</p>
            </div>
            <div class="content">
                <header class="heading">
                    <h2>Concluding thoughts</h2>
                </header>
                <h3>Future Iterations</h3>
                <p>My next step will be to create a high-fidelity prototype of Wordstock and test that version on
                    potential users. I will change the quiz so that users get immediate feedback whether their answer is
                    right or wrong. I will create an option so that the user only has to retake their incorrect answers.
                    I will include a feature to allows the user to upload multimedia to their flashcards. I would like
                    to design onboarding screens which will describe what you can do and how to use the app.</p>
                <h3>Main Takeaway</h3>
                <p>Throughout the creation of Wordstock, I have focused on the user by conducting user interviews and
                    usability testing. This enabled me to build a user-centered design of the app.</p>
